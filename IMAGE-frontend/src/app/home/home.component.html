              IMAGE focuses on genetic collections in gene banks (ex situ in vitro) rather than on live population
              management (in situ in vivo). However, the synergy between gene banks and live population management
              is a crucial issue that will be addressed by the project.

            <p>
              The aim of IMAGE is to enhance the use of genetic collections and to upgrade animal gene bank management.
              IMAGE will further develop genomic methodologies, biotechnologies, and bioinformatics for a better
              knowledge and exploitation of animal genetic resources.

              The ultimate goal of the project is to demonstrate the benefits brought by gene banks to the development
              of more sustainable livestock farming systems, in particular by:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Enhancing the usefulness of genetic collections to allow the livestock sector to respond to new
                environmental constraints and market needs;</li>
              <li>Minimising genetic accidents such as abnormalities or genetic variability tipping points;</li>
              <li>Optimising complementarity between ex-situ and in-situ conservation to maximise resources for the
                future;</li>
              <li>Making use of the latest developments in DNA technology and reproductive physiology in collecting,
                storing and using biological resources.</li>

              To reach its overall goal, the project will pursue and achieve the following scientific and technological
              objectives:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>At the scientific level, the project will develop methods and set up case studies to answer the
                following main questions:
                <ul>
                  <li>What is the genetic diversity, either between or within breeds, available in genetic collections?
                    Which part of it is not present in the mainstream livestock breeds dominating global
                    food production?</li>
                  <li>Which adaptive traits can be identified through landscape genetics in local populations? How do
                    gene banks help to elucidate the history of local populations and the history of major genes?</li>
                  <li>Which potentially detrimental variants can contribute to inbreeding depression?</li>
                  <li>Can we better predict the reproductive performance of cryobank samples to enable their
                    effective use?</li>
                  <li>Can we facilitate the effective use of samples in breeding by novel genome-assisted methods and
                    tools?</li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                At the technological level, it will design, develop and test or implement:
                <ul>
                  <li>Procedures for harmonising gene bank operations and rationalising existing collections, for
                    reproductive and biological materials;</li>
                  <li>Conservation and reproductive biotechnologies;</li>
                  <li>Bioinformatics tools to connect available data on germplasm and genomic collections in a central
                    hub.</li>

              </li>
              <li>
                At the applied level, it will design, develop and test methods and tools for stakeholders in order to:
                <ul>

                  <li>Demonstrate the use of comprehensive, species-wide comparisons of diversity parameters by
                    integrating existing information sources;</li>
                  <li>Implement access and benefit sharing (ABS) regulations.</li>
