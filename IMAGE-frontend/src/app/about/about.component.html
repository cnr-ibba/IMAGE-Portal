              One key challenge that this project addresses is the integration and transparent use of the vast
              information stored within more than 60 gene banks/genetic collections spanning 20 European countries,
              together with the collection of newly generated IMAGE data. This imposed a major strategic challenge
              for the management and conservation of animal genetic resources due to the huge amount of heterogeneous
              data distributed across gene banks in different locations, storage formats and languages. The IMAGE
              web portal integrates data from gene banks and collections with genomics data, geographical information
              systems data, and other information generated by IMAGE
            </p>
            <p>
              The solution we implemented comprises 1) a well-defined metadata rule set ensuring high quality and
              comparable data across the diverse collections originating in different storage formats and languages,
              2) development of a single Inject tool helping gene bank managers to enhance, standardise, tag and submit
              their gene bank data to a Common Data Pool that integrates all gene bank records from across Europe,
              3) the sustainability offered by archiving of this data within the EBI BioSamples public archive and
              4) a bespoke data portal that integrates gene bank metadata with generated â€˜omic datasets from within
              IMAGE and cross referencing to other gene bank and breeding database resources from across Europe such
              as those hosted by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO). Within the data portal, a Geographic
              Information System tool is included to assist the user in identifying/storing the geographical origin
              of the samples as well as displaying individual/population genetic parameters and biological attributes
              through interactive maps. Querying across all types of data is also expected to facilitate targeted
              search to identify genetic material of interest residing somewhere in the partner gene banks and
              collections.

              Furthermore, starting from data derived from the portal, computing tools and methods have
              been developed to browse the diversity of sample and/or genomic data. The Diversity Browser is a
              stand-alone tool that computes principal component analysis (PCA) of a reference dataset and a batch
              of samples of interest. Finally, an interactive web interface to guide the use of genetic material was
              created. It allows selective downloading of collection and genotype information to be leveraged using a
              linked R software package (MoBPS) that provides a computationally efficient and flexible framework
              to simulate complex breeding programs and compare their economic and genetic impact
